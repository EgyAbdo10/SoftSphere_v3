software marketplace, 
you go in, check softwares, filter by whatever domain you want, 
see the project you like, contact the developer or see their portofolio.
if you like a project or liked the abilities of a developer,
you can ask developer to add or remove some feature of the project you like
or even hire the developer, or make a freelance deal with them

like a mall but for software shops.
